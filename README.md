# livre
an comic book reader made for the web using svelte

## what is livre
livre means book in french

## how does this work
i tried to make this as simple to use as possible! you go to the site and then click add your comic, only **.cbz** files are supported, and then *ta-da*! your book opens up and you can read through it, currently localstorage is in a borked state and need somes fixing!

## how to try it out?J
